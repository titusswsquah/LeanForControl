## Purpose

Work rigorously in this Lean project.

Produce small, compiling, reviewable progress.

Do not use `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, or other shortcuts unless explicitly requested.

## Ground rules

Prefer the next correct lemma over a grand plan.

Keep proofs short when possible, but not at the cost of clarity or robustness.

Do not invent definitions if an existing project definition already fits.

Do not rewrite working code without a reason.

Do not leave broken files behind.

Every change should build.

## Workflow

Before editing:

1. identify the target file
2. inspect nearby definitions and theorem names
3. check imports
4. confirm the current build status

While editing:

1. make one small change at a time
2. run Lean often
3. isolate helper lemmas when a proof starts to sprawl
4. prefer explicit statements over clever compressed code

After editing:

1. make sure the file compiles
2. make sure the project still builds
3. note any new lemmas worth reusing later

## Proof discipline

Prefer:

- exact statements
- reusable helper lemmas
- explicit assumptions
- structural proofs over brute force
- existing library lemmas over custom reproofs

Avoid:

- giant one-shot proofs
- fragile term code when a tactic proof is clearer
- unnecessary generality
- hidden coercions you do not understand
- changing theorem statements just to make a proof easy

If a proof is stuck:

1. restate the goal in a smaller lemma
2. inspect the types with `#check`
3. search for existing lemmas with `#find` and hover
4. reduce definitional clutter with `simp?`, `rw?`, or intermediate `have` statements

## Project hygiene

Keep experiments in a scratch file, not in main library files.

Move reusable facts out of scratch once they are stable.

Keep imports as light as practical, but do not waste time micro-optimizing imports early.

Name lemmas by what they prove, not by where they came from.

Add comments only when they help a future reader follow the mathematical idea.

## Build policy

A task is not done unless it compiles.

Prefer a smaller proved result over a larger unproved draft.

If a result depends on missing infrastructure, stop and add the missing infrastructure first.

## Communication

Be concise.

State:

- what file to edit
- what lemma to prove next
- what command to run
- what obstacle is blocking progress, if any

Do not pad responses with background the user did not ask for.

## Default tools

Use these constantly:

- `lake build`
- `#check`
- `#print`
- `#find`

When needed, inspect local hypotheses and exact goal state before guessing.

## First principle

No cheats.

If something is hard, cut it into smaller true statements and prove those.

## Reporting workflow

Three artifacts, three audiences:

- **Lean source** — proof-checked. `lake build` green is the only definition of "done". `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom` count stays at zero.
- **`blueprint/web/`** — human-readable rendering. `@[blueprint "label" (statement := /-- LaTeX -/)]` exposes a decl. The `statement` is prose and is **not checked against the Lean signature**: keep it tight, never paraphrase, never overpromise. Generated nodes under `.lake/build/blueprint/` are read-only.
- **`notes/`** — append-only directory of small mini-updates named `N-slug.md`, where `N` is the next integer past the highest existing (gaps from deletions are fine, no reindexing). One focused update per file: what landed, a decision, an open follow-up, a blocker. Link to blueprint labels and Lean file:line; do not restate the math, do not paste generated content. Bridge to the next session and to web agents.

Mental model: Lean = test suite (stronger than pytests), blueprint = reviewable artifact, `notes/` = handoff.

End-of-session, project root:

```sh
lake build                          # all proofs hold
$EDITOR notes/N-<slug>.md           # one focused mini-update; N = max existing + 1
lake build :blueprint               # extract LaTeX nodes
conda activate cortese              # leanblueprint lives in env `cortese`
leanblueprint checkdecls            # every label resolves to a Lean decl
leanblueprint web                   # render blueprint/web/
git status                          # READ — see "staging discipline" below
git add <specific paths>            # prefer named paths over `-A`
git status                          # confirm what's staged before committing
git commit -m "<short, factual>"    # one commit per sprint
zip exports/N-<slug>.zip \
    $(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD -- '*.lean')   # web-agent handoff
```

The `exports/N-<slug>.zip` mirrors the basename of the new
`notes/N-<slug>.md`, contains only the `.lean` files that changed in this
sprint's commit, and is gitignored (`exports/*.zip`). Hand this zip to the
web agent alongside the matching note.

**Staging discipline.** Before staging, read `git status` carefully. If any
untracked entry looks like a build artifact, generated file, or OS junk —
`.aux`/`.log`/`.toc`/`.paux`, plastex output, `blueprint/web/`,
`blueprint/print/`, `blueprint/lean_decls`, `.DS_Store`, anything under a
new `.lake/`-style cache directory introduced by a new dep — update
`.gitignore` first, re-run `git status`, and only then stage. Use `git add -A`
**only when** you have just verified that every untracked path on the list
is something you intend to track. The cost of accidentally tracking
generated artifacts is high: the blob lives in history forever, removing it
later is messy, and the next CI/agent run will silently regenerate
divergent copies.

Commit message: lead with what changed (one line, imperative), reference the
new `notes/N-slug.md` so the handoff and the commit point at each other. Do
not push; the user pushes when ready.
